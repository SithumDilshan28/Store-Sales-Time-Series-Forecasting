# Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

## 1) Introduction

Welcome to the "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting" competition! Hosted by Kaggle, this challenge offers an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of machine learning and time-series forecasting. Our goal is to forecast grocery sales using data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a major grocery retailer based in Ecuador.

### Goal of the Competition
The main goal is predicting the unit sales of thousands of products sold at various Favorita stores. Using a dataset that includes dates, store and item information, promotions, and past sales, your mission is to build a model that forecasts sales more accurately. This is a fantastic way to practice your machine learning skills and get hands-on experience with time-series forecasting.

### Why This Matters
Forecasting is not just for predicting the weather. It's a critical tool for economic planning, scientific research, and business operations. For grocery stores, accurate forecasting can significantly reduce food waste and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring the right amount of products are available at the right time. This competition is your chance to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem, enhancing your skills and making a tangible impact.

### Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). This metric is crucial for understanding the accuracy of your predictions, focusing on the logarithmic difference between predicted and actual sales figures.
